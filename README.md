# Server Build Report - Christus Health Internship 2022

## Objective

This report outlines the implementation and benefits of using jump servers within an enterprise architecture to enhance security. Jump servers, also known as jump hosts or jump boxes, are designed to establish controlled, one-to-one connections between devices on different security zones. This approach enhances security by isolating administrative access and preventing direct exposure of sensitive servers to potential threats.

### Skills Learned

- Network Security: Understanding the principles of network segmentation and the role of jump servers in enhancing security.
- Server Configuration: Hands-on experience in configuring servers, including assigning IP addresses, setting up DNS, and managing Active Directory.
- Security Tools: Familiarity with tools like CyberArk for password management, Okta for two-factor authentication, and Solar Winds for IP management.
- Virtualization: Use of vSphere for managing virtual machines and creating content libraries.
- Monitoring and Auditing: Knowledge of implementing auditing capabilities to track user activities and changes in the server environment.

### Tools Used

- Solar Winds: For IP address management and ensuring IP address availability.
- Infoblox: For DNS management and auto-registering based on subnets.
- vSphere: For creating and managing virtual machines and updating virtual hardware.
- Active Directory (ADDS): For rights management and verifying user permissions.
- CyberArk: For providing secure, encrypted passwords that change every 24 hours.
- Okta: For implementing two-factor authentication.
- BigFix: For verifying and patching servers.
- ServiceNow: For managing service requests and incidents.

### Summary

The implementation of jump servers significantly enhances the security of an enterprise by isolating critical systems and managing administrative access. The experience gained during this internship provided valuable insights into server configuration, network security, and the use of various IT tools and applications to ensure a robust and secure IT environment.
